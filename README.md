# SmartBrain-api 

This backend work includes developing a fully functional API ,which performs various server-side operations.<br />
I have used Node.js ,Express.js for the server-side Javascript and for the database it's PostgreSQL.<br />
The application includes all the database operations such as taking  user input data and storing it into the database.
Later,when required we retrieve data from the database and render the data to UI.<br />
There are also other features such as:<br />
1.login and logout of user<br />
2.Registering a user<br />
3.rendering user profile<br />
4.Encrypting user passwords,and also authentication of the users.<br />
Thus making it a complete API.
